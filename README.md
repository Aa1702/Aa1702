## Hi there 👋  
### Hi, I’m Aarti 🌸

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 💻✨  
I’m a **Data Science student at the University of Greenwich** who loves turning ideas into things that actually *do* stuff.

### 💡 What do I enjoy?
- 📊 Data analysis & visualisations (charts make me happy)
- 🐍 Python, my comfort language
- 🌐 Building small web apps with HTML, CSS & JavaScript  
- 🗂️ Creating tools for real life  
  - a medicine reminder app for my friend  
  - planners and trackers I actually use daily  
- 🎨 Pixelated art & retro aesthetics  
- ✍️ Poems, thoughts, and words that feel like home  

### 🌱 What I’m learning right now?
- Machine Learning & applied data science  
- Making data projects cleaner, clearer, and more useful  
- Turning notebooks into real, usable apps  

### 🎯 Why I build?
I like simple tools that make life calmer, clearer, and a little kinder.  
If something can reduce stress or save time, I probably want to build it.

### ⚡ Fun facts
- I love pixel vibes more than flashy UI  
- I build things for myself first, then share them  
- If it’s practical *and* aesthetic, I’m sold  

Thanks for stopping by 💙  
Feel free to explore, star, or just vibe 🌙
